# YoctoBoard

YoctoBoard is a small but powerful keyboard. It features just a few keys, but each key can be bound to useful macros.

## Why YoctoBoard?

Yocto is the smallest metric prefix, which represents 10^-24. The end goal of this project is to create an ecosystem of modules that can be used as an ultra-powered keyboard setup for maximum productivity. The YoctoBoard is the first (and smallest) module in this ecosystem.

## Project Status

This project just started! We have grand visions for the future but it all starts small.
